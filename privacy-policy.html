                <li><strong>What Google Collects:</strong> Device ID, ad engagement, app usage patterns</li>
                <li><strong>How It's Used:</strong> To show relevant ads based on your interests</li>
                <li><strong>How to Opt-Out:</strong> Settings → Ads → Personalized Ads (toggle OFF)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>11.2 No Third-Party Ad Networks</h3>
            <p>
                We only use Google Mobile Ads. We do not use or partner with other ad networks (Facebook, Unity, Applovin, etc). This means your data isn't shared with multiple advertisers.
            </p>

            <h3>11.3 Interest-Based Advertising</h3>
            <p>
                Google uses your data to create interest categories (e.g., "Sports fans," "Tech enthusiasts"). These are not based on scanned data but on general app usage. You can manage your ad preferences at https://myadcenter.google.com
            </p>

            <h3>11.4 Advertising ID Reset</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Manage Your Google Account → Ads → Reset Advertising ID
            </p>
            <p>
                Resetting breaks the link between your previous and future ad profile.
